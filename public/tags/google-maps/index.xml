      <description>Have you ever tried to load thousands of datapoints into Google Maps? It probably didn&amp;rsquo;t go very well from a performance standpoint. Deck.gl is a library that solves this problem by running expensive computations on the GPU with WebGL. This means you can run realtime 3D visualizations on datasets with millions of geographic points.
In the following lesson, you will learn how to add high-performance data overlays to Google Maps based on a dataset of 140,000+ incidents of gun violence in the United States.</description>

      <description>Looking to build a realtime geolocation app like Lyft, Postmates, or Waze? It is easier than you might think when you combine the power of Flutter, Google Maps, and Firebase. The following lesson will show you how use Google Maps in Flutter, then listen to a realtime feed of geolocation data in Firestore queried by its distance from a centerpoint - made possible by the GeoFlutterFire package.
Special thanks to Darshan Gowda for creating the GeoFlutterFire library and providing the example code for this lesson.</description>

      <title>Realtime GeoQueries with Firestore</title>

      <description>The ability to query by geographic coordinates in Firestore is a highly requested feature because many successful apps - like Uber, Pokemon Go, Instagram, etc - use realtime maps as part of the core user experience. Today you will learn how to build a realtime Google map using Firestore as the data source.
Fingers-crossed: It&#39;s possible that Firestore will have native support for Geolcation queries in the future, but there is no public timeline for this feature that I&#39;m aware of</description>
