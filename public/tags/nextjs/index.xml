      <description>Redis is an in-memory key-value store that is often used as a cache to make traditional databases faster. However, it has evolved into a multimodel database capable of fulltext search, graph relationships, AI workloads, and more.
In the following tutorial, we use Next.js and Redis Enterprise Cloud to build a webapp that can store JSON data in the cloud, then query it with results that update instantly in the UI.</description>

      <title>Google Sheets as a Database</title>

      <description>Choosing the right database for your app is difficult. If you have a small project or are just prototyping, Google Sheets actually works quite nicely as a primary database. It is especially practical for JAM-stack web apps that use server-side rendering. The following tutorial will teach you how to use Google Sheets as a database for Next.js.
⚠️ Be warned&amp;hellip; Google Sheets does not scale like a true production database (because that&amp;rsquo;s not what it is for).</description>
