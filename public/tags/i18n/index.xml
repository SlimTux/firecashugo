      <description>Firebase hosting recently announced support for multiple hosting targets within a single project. I am thrilled to see this feature because it is such a common requirement for real world apps. For example, you might have two separate apps - one for customers, one for admin employees - both of which share the same database and functions. In the past, we would have to get clever with deployment by either sharing the same URL or juggling multiple projects.</description>
