      <title>Web Development Setup Guide for Windows with Linux (WSL)</title>
      <link>https://fireship.io/lessons/windows-10-for-web-dev/</link>

      <description>Historically, Windows has not been been the preferred OS for most web developers, but things have changed over the past couple years. Microsoft recently launched Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL (WSL2), allowing us to install REAL linux distros (like Ubuntu) on Windows 10. This means you can use Linux toolchains (bash, zsh, tmux) and apps to manage the file system and run windows apps.
Unlike a dual boot system, where two operating systems are installed on the same hard drive, WSL runs Linux in a compatibility layer that can run unmodified ELF64 binaries.</description>

      <description>Github Actions make it easy to roll out a wide variety of DevOps automation tasks. The following lesson provides five examples of CI/CD and automation using Github Actions.
Example 1: Continuous Integration Continuous Integration (CI) automates the process of testing and building your code before merging it. In practice, developers should commit or integrate their changes to the main shared repo once-per-day (or more).
Workflow file_type_light_yaml .github/workflows/workflow.yml name: Node Continuous Integration on: pull_request: branches: [ master ] jobs: test_pull_request: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: 12 - run: npm ci - run: npm test - run: npm run build Example 2: Continuous Deployment Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically releases new production code to users.</description>

      <title>Automatic Backups for Firestore via Github Actions</title>
      <link>https://fireship.io/snippets/firestore-automated-backups/</link>

      <description>As of today, Firestore does not support automatic backups, but it DOES support exports via the gcloud CLI or REST API. Although not technically a backup in database jargon, an automatic export is valuable to have for disaster recovery because it can be re-imported to replace lost data.
The following snippet exports all Firestore data automatically every day at midnight using a scheduled Github Action.
Generate a Service Key on GCP We need a service account to grant Github Actions permission to run the export command via the Google Cloud CLI.</description>
