      <description>The Firebase emulator suite allows developers to run a mock Firebase environment locally. Last week, Firebase released a new feature called the Emulator UI to visualize and manage Firestore (and Realtime DB) from the browser. The following lesson contains a variety of advanced techniques for setting up a Firebase development environment.
🌠Did you know? The new @firebase Emulator UI makes Firestore available on the browser window...
With a little bit of JS, you can extend the UI with your own custom stuff, like buttons to populate fake data.</description>

      <title>Web Development Setup Guide for Windows with Linux (WSL)</title>

      <description>Historically, Windows has not been been the preferred OS for most web developers, but things have changed over the past couple years. Microsoft recently launched Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL (WSL2), allowing us to install REAL linux distros (like Ubuntu) on Windows 10. This means you can use Linux toolchains (bash, zsh, tmux) and apps to manage the file system and run windows apps.
Unlike a dual boot system, where two operating systems are installed on the same hard drive, WSL runs Linux in a compatibility layer that can run unmodified ELF64 binaries.</description>
