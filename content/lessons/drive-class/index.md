# Second Green class

Today i went to my second driving class. It was about how much alcohool can someone drink before drive. It is forbiden to drive within an alcohool's rate equal or superior to 0.5g/l (Grains per liter) for experiencied driver, but after the teacher explained that new drivers can only have a 0.2g/l she remembered to ask for our documents.

```
**here is the climax**
```

I wasnt aware that we should bring the temporary driving licence(It has our student code), I thought only the id-card was necessary, so...
She asked if i had the documents, and I answered yes. Unfourtanely she asked to see my documents and kick me off the class, because i was not with the right document lol
